## Our Goals
The goal of this document is to set the overall tone for our community. This isn’t an exhaustive list of things you can and can't do. Rather, take this document in the spirit in which it’s intended, and try to be your best self.
We value many things beyond technical expertise, including collaboration and supporting others within our community. Providing a positive experience for other community members can have a much more significant impact than simply providing the correct answer.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by Veramo. This includes, but is not limited to, the Discord server, our repositories on GitHub, and meet-ups. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.
The Veramo Code of Conduct applies equally to all members of the community, including staff.
