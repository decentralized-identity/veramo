## Agent.emit() method

Broadcasts an `Event` to potential listeners.

Listeners are `IEventListener` instances that declare `eventTypes` and implement an `async onEvent({type, data}, context)` method. Note that `IAgentPlugin` is also an `IEventListener` so plugins can be listeners for events.

During creation, the agent automatically registers listener plugins to the `eventTypes` that they declare.

Events are processed asynchronously, so the general pattern to be used is fire-and-forget. Ex: `agent.emit('foo', {eventData})`

In situations where you need to make sure that all events in the queue have been exhausted, the `Promise` returned by `emit` can be awaited. Ex: `await agent.emit('foo', {eventData})`

In case an error is thrown while processing an event, the error is re-emitted as an event of type `error` with a `EventListenerError` as payload.

Note that `await agent.emit()` will NOT throw an error. To process errors, use a listener with `eventTypes: ["error"]` in the definition.
