## SelectiveDisclosure class

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

This class adds support for creating [Selective Disclosure](https://github.com/uport-project/specs/blob/develop/flows/selectivedisclosure.md) requests and interpret the responses received.

This implementation of the uPort protocol uses [W3C Presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations) as the response encoding instead of a `shareReq`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class SelectiveDisclosure implements IAgentPlugin
