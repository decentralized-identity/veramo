## Agent class

Provides a common context for all plugin methods.

This is the main entry point into the API of the DID Agent Framework. When plugins are installed, they extend the API of the agent and the methods they provide can all use the common context so that plugins can build on top of each other and create a richer experience.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class Agent implements IAgent 
```
<b>Implements:</b> [IAgent](./daf-core.iagent.md)
