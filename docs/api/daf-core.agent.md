## Agent class

Provides a common context for all plugin methods.

This is the main entry point into the API of the DID Agent Framework. When plugins are installed, they extend the API of the agent and the methods they provide can all use the common context so that plugins can build on top of each other and create a richer experience.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class Agent implements IAgent 
```
<b>Implements:</b> [IAgent](./daf-core.iagent.md)

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [availableMethods()](./daf-core.agent.availablemethods.md) |  | Lists available agent method names |
|  [emit(eventType, data)](./daf-core.agent.emit.md) |  | Broadcasts an <code>Event</code> to potential listeners.<!-- -->Listeners are <code>IEventListener</code> instances that declare <code>eventTypes</code> and implement an <code>async onEvent({type, data}, context)</code> method. Note that <code>IAgentPlugin</code> is also an <code>IEventListener</code> so plugins can be listeners for events.<!-- -->During creation, the agent automatically registers listener plugins to the <code>eventTypes</code> that they declare.<!-- -->Events are processed asynchronously, so the general pattern to be used is fire-and-forget. Ex: <code>agent.emit('foo', {eventData})</code>In situations where you need to make sure that all events in the queue have been exhausted, the <code>Promise</code> returned by <code>emit</code> can be awaited. Ex: <code>await agent.emit('foo', {eventData})</code>In case an error is thrown while processing an event, the error is re-emitted as an event of type <code>error</code> with a <code>EventListenerError</code> as payload.<!-- -->Note that <code>await agent.emit()</code> will NOT throw an error. To process errors, use a listener with <code>eventTypes: [&quot;error&quot;]</code> in the definition. |
|  [execute(method, args)](./daf-core.agent.execute.md) |  | Executes a plugin method.<!-- -->Normally, the <code>execute()</code> method need not be called. The agent will expose the plugin methods directly on the agent instance but this can be used when dynamically deciding which methods to call. |
|  [getSchema()](./daf-core.agent.getschema.md) |  | Returns agent plugin schema |
